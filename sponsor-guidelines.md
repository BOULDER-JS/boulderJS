# Sponsoring SeattleJS

BoulderJS could not exist without the support of the community, and this includes companies who understand the importance of investing in the local developer community. Improving the quality of the developer community in and around Boulder means that better products and services are built here and hopefully more companies choose to stay here. As part of sponsorship, sponsors are featured on the sponsor bar of our meetup page and given an opportunity to say a word about their company (great for recruiting!)

## How You Can Help

BoulderJS meets every month. Our events are free for participants, we rely on sponsors to help pay for food and drink.
