#### Abstract:

#### The best Firebase crash course you never knew you needed

Firebase is a platform for building awesome things. Sync data in realtime across devices. Upload files. Run server code. Authenticate users. Push notifications. Blazing fast web hosting. All without running your own server. Each piece of Firebase can work independently, but they are powerful when used together. David East will teach you how to build an app with Firebase from scratch.

#### Demystifying State Machines

User interfaces on the web are more complex today than ever before, so state design is more important now than ever before. In this talk, attendees will learn the fundamentals of state machines and how they help solve many of the difficulties inherent in managing application state by lowering cognitive overhead, mitigating bugs, and reducing regressions.
