### Production WebAssembly

So you have compiled WebAssembly code. Now what? The challenge then becomes integrating it into a real-world application. This talk will discuss the nuances in integrating a Rust-based cryptography library compiled to WebAssembly in a production application. I'll cover how to pass complex arguments to WebAssembly, how to use WebWorkers, and how to dynamically load WebAssembly modules so developers get a sense of what it will actually take to adopt WebAssembly and when and why they should.

### Programming robots with JS' mini-workshop

**Instead of having a second speaker for this meetup we are going to do a mini-workshop to so bring your machine of choice and creativity if you would like to participate**

Misty robotics will be showing how easy it is to program robots using RESTful API's and JavaScript. If you've been curious about interacting with hardware or want to get your feet wet with robotics, this is a great opportunity to understand the basics.

#### Understand persistence data structures

In the last few years, this is a growing interest in persistent data structures, motivated by omnipresent of interactive systems. Functional languages, like Clojure, Scala, and Elm, provide them as part of the standard library, and libraries in other languages like Immutable.js are widely used. In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of immutability and how to utilize persistent data structures in practice. Then I will show how to build an effective and flexible persistent vector type using Radix Trie.
