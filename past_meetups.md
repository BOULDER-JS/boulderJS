#### You don't need JavaScript

Learn how to use CSS to replace your JS, improve performance, and accessibility. And see the potential Web Assembly has to help us replace JS where it makes sense.

#### How to Add Data Privacy to Your App

Even the coolest user interfaces won’t cover for apps that are insecure and leak private information. As JavaScript developers, we need to build apps that stand up to the demands of our industry and protects the data and privacy of our users.

In this talk, you will learn:
* Why your app requires data control to guard against data proliferation.
* How HTTP Interceptors work in Angular.
* How class decorators work in Angular / Typescript.
* How to add policy based encryption to your application using HTTP Interceptors and decorators.
* How to separate what data to encrypt from who should be able to decrypt it.
* How data control works under the hood.

#### Demystifying State Machines

User interfaces on the web are more complex today than ever before, so state design is more important now than ever before. In this talk, attendees will learn the fundamentals of state machines and how they help solve many of the difficulties inherent in managing application state by lowering cognitive overhead, mitigating bugs, and reducing regressions.

#### Assembling the Web with Rust

Want to create powerful, high-performance web apps? Stuck at a bottleneck? Then this talk is for you!

Instead of a regular performance talk, we'll focus here on abstracting key parts of your web app into Webassembly. By compiling Rust, a memory and thread-safe language, into Webassembly code, we can swap out bits of Javascript for a faster codebase. We'll explore use cases and examples, with a focus on real-world problems that we can theoretically solve with wasm and Rust!

#### Making it Look Good: the React Native Version

The line between an application feeling professional and amateurish can be pretty fine. What’s the cause? I’d argue that being skilled in working with the styling system in whatever language/framework is the thing that pushes you into that polished state.

React Native is no different. The system takes much inspiration from the web. It uses a very CSS-like syntax to apply styling and a subset of the flex box spec for its layout mechanism.

Let’s take a tour through styling things in React Native and talk about some strategies for implementing a maintainable system for styling that’ll make it easier to keep your app polished.

#### The best Firebase crash course you never knew you needed

Firebase is a platform for building awesome things. Sync data in realtime across devices. Upload files. Run server code. Authenticate users. Push notifications. Blazing fast web hosting. All without running your own server. Each piece of Firebase can work independently, but they are powerful when used together. David East will teach you how to build an app with Firebase from scratch.
