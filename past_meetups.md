#### Making it Look Good: the React Native Version

The line between an application feeling professional and amateurish can be pretty fine. What’s the cause? I’d argue that being skilled in working with the styling system in whatever language/framework is the thing that pushes you into that polished state.

React Native is no different. The system takes much inspiration from the web. It uses a very CSS-like syntax to apply styling and a subset of the flex box spec for its layout mechanism.

Let’s take a tour through styling things in React Native and talk about some strategies for implementing a maintainable system for styling that’ll make it easier to keep your app polished.

#### The best Firebase crash course you never knew you needed

Firebase is a platform for building awesome things. Sync data in realtime across devices. Upload files. Run server code. Authenticate users. Push notifications. Blazing fast web hosting. All without running your own server. Each piece of Firebase can work independently, but they are powerful when used together. David East will teach you how to build an app with Firebase from scratch.
