# Call for Speakers

We host meetups each month on the third Wednesday. A typical meetup has two 30-minute _feature_ talks covering all things JavaScript.

Our speakers are folks just like you!

This is a great opportunity to share what you know with the community, meet new people, and impress your boss with your public-speaking skills.

## How it works

- Read the guidelines below.
- Submit a proposal via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/boulder-js/boulderjs/issues/new) or email talks@seattlejs.com. Please follow the [template](#talk-proposal-template).
- If the proposal sounds like something that will work for our members, we'll group the talk with similar proposals and schedule it.

## What makes a good talk?

Seattle.JS has over 4,000 members, but obviously not every one shows up for each meetup (eek! where would we put them?). The audience ranges from experienced engineers who remember Life Before Chrome to newbies writing their first event listener.

Since our community has such a broad range of experience and interests, there isn't a one-size-fits-all talk. We group proposals into similar themes for each meetup, and the folks that are interested in the topic will come out.

## What's in a proposal?

In your proposal, tell us about your talk and a little about you. If you have any additional materials, like a slide deck, site, or repo, please link to them. [Here's a template](#talk-proposal-template).

## Talk Proposal Template

```
# Title of talk

A short description of the talk. The goal should be to explain to people WHY this topic is interesting and HOW it will help them be better developers or build better applications. 1-2 paragraphs is fine.

Include a short bio--anything that gives us an idea of why you're qualified to speak on this subject. Feel free to include any relevant links.
